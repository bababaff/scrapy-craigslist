A family-owned business with over 35 years in the industry. We are currently looking for ARCHITECTURAL DRAFTERS / SURVEYORS. This is a Full-Time Employment position that will be paid on a Salary basis - we are not looking for Contractors at this time. The position is somewhat of an ""entry-level"" position that requires about 3-6 months of training on our process and workflow. 

We are open to candidates with no previous CAD Experience as we prioritize other factors first. Primarily we are looking for someone with great Customer Service Skills, Promptness, Quick Learner and excellent ability to Communicate. Since we will do all the training in regards to the CAD skills required, we believe that our ideal candidate will possess these attributes.

This is a very specialized position that entails drafting in real-time on-site (using laser to cad technology) and then completing those drawings back in the office. We have created a specific software and process to do this work and will provide all the training and equipment necessary to learn. Once again no CAD skills are necessary for this position, but they would be a plus. 

We are based in Canoga Park and a majority of our business takes place in the Southern California area but our projects occur throughout the U.S. so there will be air travel. The travel is a large part of this position, as sometimes it is easier and faster to stay locally to a property vs. traveling to and from. The travel can sometimes be short notice or for extended periods - we do try and avoid this if at all possible. We work on a variety of different types of properties (Commercial, Retail, Residential, etc.) so it's always interesting and different from project to project. There is a comfortable mix of spending time working in the office and out in the field surveying.

All Applicants must have reliable transportation and be dependable. Since a good portion of our work is in the L.A. and surrounding areas it is preferred that all applicants currently live in the vicinity of the office and will be willing to commute to our location 5 days a week.

Skills required;

Customer Service Oriented
Full knowledge of Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, Outlook, etc.)
Excellent Communication Skills
Self-Motivated
Able to work alone
Team player
Architectural Knowledge a plus (Construction, Design, etc.) 
AutoCAD and/or Revit experience a plus (CAD training provided)
Survey experience a plus (Survey training will be provided)
Reliable Transportation and a Valid Driver's License
Ability to Travel (air travel and local travel - possibly for extended periods/short notice)
