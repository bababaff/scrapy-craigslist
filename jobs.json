The position is somewhat of an \"entry-level\" position that requires about 3-6 months of training on our process and workflow. \n\nWe are open to candidates with no previous CAD Experience as we prioritize other factors first.

The travel is a large part of this position, as sometimes it is easier and faster to stay locally to a property vs. traveling to and from. The travel can sometimes be short notice or for extended periods - we do try and avoid this if at all possible. We work on a variety of different types of properties (Commercial, Retail, Residential, etc.) so it's always interesting and different from project to project. There is a comfortable mix of spending time working in the office and out in the field surveying.\n\nAll Applicants must have reliable transportation and be dependable. Since a good portion of our work is in the L.A. and surrounding areas it is preferred that all applicants currently live in the vicinity of the office and will be willing to commute to our location 5 days a week.\n\nSkills required;\n\nCustomer Service Oriented\nFull knowledge of Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, Outlook, etc.)\nExcellent Communication Skills\nSelf-Motivated\nAble to work alone\nTeam player\nArchitectural Knowledge a plus (Construction, Design, etc.) \nAutoCAD and/or Revit experience a plus (CAD training provided)\nSurvey experience a plus (Survey training will be provided)\nReliable Transportation and a Valid Driver's License\nAbility to Travel (air travel and local travel - possibly for extended periods/short notice)\n\n\nPlease respond to this ad with your resume, and an introduction while briefly explaining why you think you'd be a good fit for this position.
